        "Почему сценарий $s_{13}$ наилучший? Это сценарий, когда сушеная фасоль содержит больше всего кальция в сравнении с другими сценариями. Следовательно, меньшим кол-вом фасоли можно закрыть потребность в кальции, а это приводит к снижению стоимости. Наилучший сценарий берется для того, чтобы была возможность ухудшать решение по затратам и улучшать по валидности (удовлетворению нормам) в разрезе каждого из сценариев в отдельности.\n"
